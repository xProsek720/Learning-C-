# Learning-C-sharp
My process of Learning C# and practitcing GitHub. 
I've used polish in this project, but that's only because it will be easier for me to check up on something
 if I forget how to do something.

If you already know C# and you aren't Recruiter then It shouldn't matter for you,
but I want to welcome everyone that wants to check it out!
